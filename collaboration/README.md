# collaboration

We all, as developers, usually are too proud, we know it, and sometimes things like doing a good code review are complicated. For that, we want people to refer to this guidelines in terms of collaboration. We did not write them ourselves, but we agree with their ideas. You can find them in the following links:

-   [Code Review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/code-review)
-   [Inclusive Culture](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/inclusive-culture)
-   [Terminology](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/terminology)
-   [Working Together](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/working-together)
