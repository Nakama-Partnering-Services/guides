# Ways of working.

Please refer to this guidelines in terms of collaboration. We did not write them ourselves, but we agree with their ideas.

You can find them in the following links:

- [Code Review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/code-review)
- [Inclusive Culture](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/inclusive-culture)
- [Terminology](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/terminology)
- [Working Together](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/working-together)

Also, in our code reviews, we mainly double check that our conventions and best practices are followed, however, for a detailed checklist of the main things to take into account, you can refer to our [Code Review Checklist](./8-code_review_checklist.md).
